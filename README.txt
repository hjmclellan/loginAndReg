STILL IN PROGRESS

Purpose: Familiarization with data validation

This is a simple login and registration form; is meant to work with the loginandreg database, but can be re-utilized
Function took precedence over styling (clearly)
There are still bugs being worked out (Page will flash a success message after refreshing, login page needs a different redirect route, etc.)

File functions
    Static - CSS styling
    Templates- HTML for individual pages
    Server files - python server file and connector to MySQL
    Pipfile contains installation of flask, PyMySQL, and flask-bcrypt

Current intended featured
    Hashed passwords
    User information saved in session (broken as of 4/23)
    Success page should only be visible to logged in users

In progress Additions
    User Profile page - allows user to edit their information or delete their "account"
