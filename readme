# Login and Registration

This is a simple login and registration form; it's meant to work with the included loginandreg database, but can be re-utilized
Function took precedence over styling (clearly), but styling will be revisited once function is perfected
There are still bugs being worked out (Page will flash a success message after refreshing, login page needs a different redirect route, etc.)
